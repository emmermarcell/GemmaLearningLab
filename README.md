# GemmaTutorLab

**GemmaTutorLab** is a proof-of-concept Android app leveraging Google’s Gemma-3n model to tutor Hungarian kids entirely offline. It processes screenshots and voice inputs, creates flashcards and quizzes, and offers interactive learning without internet or subscription requirements. Designed to support education locally with a smart, accessible, and playful learning companion.

The Hungarian education system faces several challenges, including a lack of funding for teachers and equipment. A major issue is that many kids need private tutors because the underfunded school system cannot adequately meet their learning needs or explain information properly. This project aims to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) Android application that leverages the multimodal capabilities of **Gemma-3n** to handle some of the tasks a private tutor would do — running entirely locally on the phone without requiring internet connectivity after the model is downloaded, and without monthly subscription fees since the model hosting happens on the user's device.

## Main Features

- Take screenshots of pages from current notes or book chapters → Gemma-3n processes these images.
- (Optional future) Upload a PDF → automatically split into chapters.
- Chat interface for discussion, powered by a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) agent built from uploaded pages.
- Voice interaction about the content using Gemma-3n’s audio input capabilities (potentially finetuned for Hungarian). Output text can be converted to speech via TTS (great for kids with reading difficulties).
- Flashcard creation from uploaded pages to practice definitions.
- Quiz bank and quiz creation to test kids' knowledge.

## Tasks

- Build main features on Kaggle.
- Learn Kotlin basics.
- Develop the Android app in Kotlin using Google’s example project: [Google AI Edge Gallery](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/gallery).
- Deploy the latest Gemma-3n E2B model that supports audio input.
- Finetune Gemma-3n for Hungarian text and audio using [Unsloth](https://docs.unsloth.ai/basics/gemma-3n-how-to-run-and-fine-tune). Await the release of official Gemma-3n notebooks for easier tuning.
- Investigate deploying models with LoRA adapters for efficient finetuning.
- Find and integrate a suitable TTS model.
- Optional: Dynamically adjust the model size based on available VRAM on users’ phones using Gemma-3n’s Matformer architecture.

## Notes

- The gemma-3n-E2B-it-int4 model fits into the GPU VRAM of a Samsung S22+.
- Hungarian text generation quality is currently subpar.

## Notes for Finetuning

- [Unsloth released a notebook for parameter-efficient training of Gemma-3n on multimodal data](https://colab.research.google.com/github/unslothai/notebooks/blob/main/nb/Gemma3N_%284B%29-Conversational.ipynb)
